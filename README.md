This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving undefined behavior when using raw pointers with vectors.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which modifies a vector's data through a raw pointer after potential reallocation. This leads to undefined behavior.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version, demonstrating safer ways to manipulate vector data.
